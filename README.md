# SENZ Wifi Integration for Home Assistant

This integration will represent your SENZ WiFi thermostats as climate entities in Home Assistant. There is also a temperature sensor to simplify use in the UI.

## Installation

Make sure you have the credentials available for your account with nVent cloud.

### Preferred download method

- Use HACS, add this repo as a custom repository and install SENZ WiFi integration.
- Restart Home Assistant

### Manual download method

- Copy all files from custom_components/senz in this repo to your config custom_components/senz
- Restart Home Assistant

### Setup

In Home Assistant 2022.3 or later the client_id/client_secret will be handled by NabuCasa account linking. You will not need your own credentials from the manufacturer and you don't need to enter anything into `configuration.yaml`.

If you are using an older version if Home Assistant you must request a client_id and client_secret from the [manufacturer SENZ/Raychem](https://api.senzthermostat.nvent.com/). Ask for a set of credentials for Home Assistant integration.
Enter following lines to `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
senz:
  client_id: your_client_id
  client_secret: your_client_secret
```

Goto Integrations->Add and select Senz WiFi

Follow instructions to authenticate with nVent cloud server. Allow full access for Home Assistant client.
